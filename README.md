# 20 Games Challenge

This is a repository for my attempt at following the 20 games challenge (https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io).
Here I will maintain all of my work, partially just so I can get it from my laptop to my desktop and vice versa for when I am traveling around.

For my attempt at the challenge I'll be using Godot and C#, though who knows maybe I'll pivot later on. Probably not though.

## List of Games
* Pong (WIP)
